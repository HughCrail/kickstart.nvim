- <leader>D should only show diagnostics for the current git root
- ctrl-t should cycle TODO states on current comment line
- When selecting a project (or anything from a snacks picker) it should put the
  resulting buffer in the window I embarked from -- I think this happens when
two buffers of the same file are open
- Quick open weekly org file
- overseer template to select a .t.{ts,js} file and run it
- find other file .cpp -> .h etc..
- better default diffview mergetool layout
- check autocmd to change root works when current dir is a git dir
- why do things not get added to project picker (should we have a simpler find
git dir?)
- alt-k alt-j should move thing up 
- Get rid of messages for yank / paste
- Quickly open special files like default.config, global rplus.json,
blpwtkctrl.dat
- key to clear notifications
